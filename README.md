# Synteny and rearrangement of 3 Eucalyptus

All genomes were assembled and annoated using https://www.protocols.io/view/plant-assemble-plant-de-novo-genome-assembly-scaff-81wgb6zk3lpk/v1

Genomes were then aligned with nucmer (MUMmer), annotated for syntenic regions and rearrangements with SyRI.
Genomes, genes, transposons, and alignments were processed with the script in this repository.

All work is for the publication: 
Ferguson S, Jones A, Murray K, Schwessinger B, & Borevitz J (2023). Interspecies genome divergence is predominantly due to frequent small scale rearrangements in Eucalyptus. Molecular Ecology, 32, 1271â€“1287. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16608
